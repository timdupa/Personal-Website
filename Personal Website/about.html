			<h2 style="text-align: center;">School</h2>
				<p class="text">When I first started my college career, I pursued a degree in Biology at Georgia College &amp; State University. After 2 years, I realized that my passion was elsewhere. Fall semester of my 3rd year, I decided to change majors to Computer Science. Changing majors has reignited my passion in learning. I am looking forward to graduating in December 2018 and starting a career in a field that I love.</p>

			<h2 style="text-align: center;">Work</h2>
				<p class="text">I currently work at the Serve Help Desk. Serve provides technology support to students, faculty, and staff around campus. We provided hardware diagnosis as well as over-the-phone support. Having a job on campus has allowed me to experience multiple opportunities. My job at Serve has also shown me a path to my future internship. In the Summer of 2018, I will be an intern for Georgia College &amp; State University's Enterprise Applications. I am excited to see where my internship takes me.</p>
